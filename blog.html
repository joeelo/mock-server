  <p>Hi, fellow pet parents! I receive a lot of questions about pup health and proper nutrition, so I thought I’d create a blog here at DrJeffsPets.com to answer some of your most common concerns. <br></p>
  <p>One question I get asked a lot is: Are fish oils and omega-3s good for my dog?
  </p>

  <p>The short answer is YES. Let me explain the many, many benefits of omega-3s:</p>
  <p>Dogs have a nutritional need for omega-3 fatty acids in their diets, just like people do. And just like with humans, a dog’s body does not naturally create enough of their own omega-3s. So, introducing foods that are rich in these essential fatty acids will offer major health benefits for your pal</p>
  <p>The two main pro-inflammatory omega-3s are docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), both of which are found in fatty fish (especially salmon, tuna, sardines, trout and mackerel), shellfish, seaweed, kelp and krill.</p>
  <p>Omega-3 fatty acids are like the fountain of youth for dogs. They help with skin and coat conditions, allergies, kidney and heart health, immune system strength, joint and hip support, mental health, and so much more. This is the reason I added ingredients loaded with omega-3s to Dr. Jeff’s Optimum [link to new product page] and Daily Canine Care [link to new product page].</p>

  <p>Let me go into more detail about the five most important ways these beneficial oils contribute to a dog’s health.</p>
  <p>Allergies <br>Allergies
    Fish oils have anti-inflammatory benefits for dogs, which greatly reduce the symptoms of many allergies — and can even help to build immunities to allergies when taken consistently.</p>
  <p>Kidney Diseases <br>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and compromised kidney function are common issues with dogs. Some signs of a kidney problem may be increased thirst or frequent urinations, decreased appetite, weight loss, bad breath, vomiting or diarrhea. </p>
  <p>Fish oils have been shown to have a very positive effect on canine kidney health. A diet rich in omega-3s can significantly help slow the progress of many renal diseases and kidney disorders. </p>

  <p>Brain Health <br> Many older dogs suffer from the same sort of mental health issues that people do in their older years. For canines, Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome is a chronic disease that is very similar to Alzheimer’s disease in people. It’s estimated that 28% of dogs aged 11 to 12 years old have CDS, and nearly 60% percent of dogs aged 15 to 16 show signs of this disease. Symptoms may appear as disorientation, forgetting their house-training, or even behavioral changes around family members.</p>
  <p>Omega-3s have been clinically proven to improve cognitive function in dogs. Fish oils rich in DHA can increase memory and mental clarity, and improve overall temperament and behavior. </p>
  <p>Arthritis <br>According to the Arthritis Foundation, one in five dogs suffers from canine arthritis. You might notice your dog slowing down on walks, or having trouble getting into the car, or even having a problem standing after taking a nap. These could be signs of arthritis.</p>
  <p>Dogs switching to a diet rich in omega-3s showed dramatic improvements in all of these conditions and more. And not just for treating these problems, but also preventing them. Additionally, many medications for treating canine arthritis are made with fish oil.</p>
  <p>Heart Problems <br>Dogs that were fed meals containing fish oils were shown to live longer lives and maintain healthier body weights than dogs not consuming fish oils. The same omega-3 anti‐inflammatory benefits that relieve allergy symptoms also improve heart rates and blood pressure, and even reduce the risk of stroke.</p>
  <p>Additionally, a diet rich in fish oil may help to manage arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat) and regulate proper blood flow — two common causes of canine congestive heart failure. </p>
