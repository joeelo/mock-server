  <p>All dogs are susceptible to a variety of different health problems, regardless of their size. That’s just part of life. But there are certain health issues that are more common in larger dogs, and other health issues that seem to be unique to smaller dogs. But whether one size has more problems than the other is difficult to say.</p>
  <p>Let me explain...</p>

  <p><strong>Looks Can Be Deceiving</strong></p>
  <p>First off, dogs are one of the most diverse species on Earth. At last count, there were more than 360 officially recognized dog breeds around the world — with about 190 of those breeds here in the United States. There are also many mixed breeds and designer crossbreeds that are too varied or too rare to classify as an official breed. But, believe me, there are a lot of different types of dogs out there these days.</p>
  <p>Secondly, all dogs are almost identical on a genetic level — whether it’s a 6-pound poodle or a 120-pound Great Pyrenees — because they all evolved from the same animal thousands of years ago: the wolf. 
  </p>
  <p><strong>But There Are Big Differences, Too</strong></p>

  <p>To get to the point, yes, there are major differences between smaller dogs and larger dogs — beyond the size. Larger dogs have an average heart rate of 60 to 100 beats per minute, while smaller dogs’ hearts beat anywhere from 100 to 140 beats per minute.</p>
  <p>Large dogs also age faster than smaller dogs. Research tells us that large dogs usually live to about 10 to 12 years of age, while small dogs can live up to 14 to even 16 years. Again, these are statistical averages. Variables like diet, stress and environment can increase or decrease those averages by years. I’ve treated healthy dogs — both large and small — that have lived to be almost 20 years old.</p>
  <p>With that in mind, let me shed a little light on some common health problems affecting both dog sizes…and perhaps explain how that size difference plays a part in the problem.</p>
  <p><strong>There’s a Lot of Legwork Involved</strong></p>

  <p>Larger dogs tend to have more problems with their hips and elbows (you may have heard your vet mention the technical terms <strong>hip dysplasia</strong> or <strong>elbow dysplasia)</strong>. These issues could be as a result of their greater body weight and/or a less-active lifestyle. </p>
  <p>Smaller dogs tend to have more knee problems. A common issue in smaller dogs is called <strong>patellar luxation</strong> (when the kneecap slips out of place, causing discomfort and limited movement). And this could be caused by their overactive behavior and Spider-Man-like leaping abilities.</p>
  <p><strong>The Inside Information</strong></p>
  <p>Larger dogs tend to suffer from <strong>arthritis, bone inflammation</strong> and <strong>canine cancer</strong> more often than smaller dogs. Large-breed dogs also seem to be more susceptible to heart-related issues, such as <strong>dilated cardiomyopathy</strong> (an enlarged heart that doesn’t pump properly) and a hereditary heart disease called <strong>aortic stenosis</strong> (a narrowing of the aorta, which can cause fainting, murmurs, and even heart failure).</p>
  <p><strong>The Bigger They Are...</strong></p>
  <p>You’ve probably heard of hypothyroidism. <strong>Hypothyroidism</strong> is a deficiency in the thyroid gland, which affects a dog’s metabolism (which means they have a problem converting food into energy). Although this issue can affect all sizes of dog, it mainly targets medium to large dogs — like Golden Retrievers and Doberman Pinschers. </p>

  <p><strong>Wobbler Syndrome</strong> (cervical spondylomyelopathy) is a disease of the neck that commonly affects larger dogs — mostly Doberman Pinschers, for some reason. It occurs when the spinal cord in the neck becomes compressed, which can lead to neck discomfort and nervous system problems (like wobbling).</p>
  <p><strong>A Little Small Talk</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Pancreatitis</strong> (when the pancreas becomes inflamed, causing fever, vomiting, diarrhea and pain) can affect all dogs — but it seems to occur more often in smaller dogs.</p>
  <p>Smaller dogs are also more physically fragile than larger dogs, and usually more physically active, too. This can lead to broken bones from being accidentally stepped on or tripped over. Additionally, smaller dogs with shorter hair tend to be more susceptible to cold weather, which can dangerously lower their internal body temperature. A really hot summer day can also lead to a heat stroke. </p>
  <p><strong>But All Things Considered</strong></p>
  <p>This is by no means an exhaustive list of all the different health problems that can affect dogs, whether they’re small or large. But I wanted to show you how size may play a factor in their health.</p>

  <p>But we also can’t discount factors like activity levels, nutrition, climate, households, and hereditary issues. My advice for you is to stay up-to-date on your vet visits and vaccinations, feed them balanced and nutritious meals, provide them with plenty of exercise, and love them like they’re a member of your family. </p>
