  <p>As a pet parent, it’s hard to enjoy a nice dinner at home when you’ve got a pair of puppy dog eyes watching every bite you take. Most dogs are masters of the “feed me, I’m starving” guilt-trip.</p>
  <p>We’d all love to share a little morsel of our meals with them. But as hard as it may sometimes be, you have to be a strict parent when it comes to what your pets eat. Because dogs will typically eat <strong>ANYTHING</strong>  that’s in front of them. And it’s up to you to protect them.</p>
  <p>Dogs and humans share many of the same qualities, but food isn’t one of them. Many types of foods — including some fruits and vegetables — can cause serious health problems to dogs and, in some cases, even death. </p>

  <p>Instead of sharing all the many, many foods that you SHOULD NEVER give to your dog, I’m going to list the 15 foods that YOU CAN SHARE with your pal — in very small amounts! Just remember, servings of table-scraps should never exceed 10% of your dog’s daily calorie intake. More than that can be potentially dangerous to their health.</p>
  <p>If a type of food is not on the list below, assume that it is too dangerous to feed your dog. </p>
  <br>
  <h3>The Safe-in-a-Small-Amount List:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Bread — plain; without seeds, spices, raisins or artificial sweeteners.</li>
    <li>Cashews (only a few) — Cashews are packed with calcium, protein and minerals. But most other nuts may cause seizures, vomiting or other problems.</li>
    <li>Cheese (unless they’re lactose intolerant) — Preferably low-fat, like mozzarella. And make sure it’s not made with an artificial sweetener.
    </li>
    <li>Coconut — Great for a dog’s skin, coat, breath and certain allergies.</li>
    <li>Corn (small amount only) — Corn is used in many dog foods, but corn kernels are not easily digestible. Keep an eye on how your dog processes it.</li>
    <li>Eggs (fully cooked) — A great source of protein for dogs.</li>
    <li>Fish (fully cooked, bones removed) — Packed with omega-3s and amino acids.</li>
    <li>Ham (fully cooked) — A great source of protein, but very high in fat.</li>
    <li> Milk (unless they’re lactose intolerant) — But only a small amount.</li>
    <li>Peanut butter (raw and unsalted) — Offers dogs protein, vitamins and minerals (and it’s fun to watch them eat it).</li>
    <li> Popcorn (unsalted, unbuttered, air-popped, no artificial sweetener) — A small amount of popcorn tastes great and offers dogs riboflavin and thiamine (but make sure all the kernels are popped).</li>
    <li> Pork (fully cooked) — It’s packed with digestible protein and loaded with amino acids. Remember, only a small amount.</li>
    <li>Shrimp (fully cooked; with shell, tail, head and legs removed) — One shrimp once-in-a-while is a great source of omega-3 fatty acids for skin, coat and allergies.</li>
    <li>Turkey (fully cooked) — Great source of protein, but remove excess fat and skin first.</li>
    <li>Wheat — Grains like wheat, corn, sorghum and buckwheat provide dogs with protein, fatty acids and fiber. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>And by all means, NEVER feed your dog any sort of food that was prepared with garlic, onions, chives, avocados, raisins, grapes, nutmeg or chocolate. And avoid all foods containing artificial sweeteners (check the nutrition label closely, because some brands may use sugar substitutes). </p><br>
