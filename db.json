Let me explain the many, many benefits of omega-3s:</p><p>Dogs have a nutritional need for omega-3 fatty acids in their diets, just like people do. And just like with humans, a dog’s body does not naturally create enough of their own omega-3s. So, introducing foods that are rich in these essential fatty acids will offer major health benefits for your pal.</p><p>The two main pro-inflammatory omega-3s are docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), both of which are found in fatty fish (especially salmon, tuna, sardines, trout and mackerel), shellfish, seaweed, kelp and krill.</p>"
